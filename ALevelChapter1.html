		<h2>Computational Thinking</h2>
		<img src="Images/computational-thinking.jpg" style="width:50%; margin:15px;">
		<h3 id="D">Decomposition</h3>
			<p> Decomposition allows the programmer to break down a problem into steps or parts which can in turn be separately worked on, then eventually pieced together to form a whole program. For example if you were doing a jigsaw of a road you might put all the bits of a car together then put them in as a whole block, or you might gather all the sky pieces together and do them as a block so that you have less pieces to work with on each section of the jigsaw.<br /><br />
				Decomposition is good because it speeds up the rate problems can be solved as well as meaning future problems can copy blocks from past problems that are similar further speeding the process up.<br /><br />
				Decomposition is only useful on larger and more complex problems, on smaller/simpler problems decomposition only takes up time that could be better put just doing the problem as a whole.<br /><br /></p>
		<h3 id="AB">Abstraction</h3>
			<p> Abstraction allows the programmer to remove unnecessary information from the problem they're dealing with allowing them to only focus on the aspects of the problem that need solving. An example of this would be in a driving game for instance, while the programmers would have to write code for all the external details of buildings and surrounding scenery etc they wouldn't have to code in all the interiors of buildings or underground. Abstraction allows them to forget these details to enhance the finished result.<br /><br />
				This is useful because when dealing with large problems such as designing a map, all the fine details of the real world make life very difficult, so the process of abstraction simplifies the details. So in the maps case you would simplify sweeping bendy roads to straight lines etc.<br /><br />
				Similarly to decomposition, on very small problems there is unlikely to be anything worth removing from the problem with abstraction thus it is only useful on bigger more complex problems.<br /><br /></p>
